# Delivery Load Planner
is a final project for [webCS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/ "webCS50 Home") by Jurijs V. "Laacis". Developed from 23.10. - 17.12.2022.


## What is it about?
This is first of all a final project for [webCS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/ "webCS50 Home").
The idea of building a Tour planner that generates loading list for the Reefer/Truck and would be available for Driver on mobile or any other device, came from real world as I work in logistics and transportation of temperature controlled goods. We often have issues with that the peson who is planing the loading list has to know a lot about the Tour and delivery plan. And when this person is sick or this task is given to somebody else, who is not as experienced, then the loading time and delivery time grow significantyly. It depends on losts of factors, that have to be taken in accouning. 
I had to make a research on how this is working, combining it with ideas of how I would do it, if I had to design such solution.
Actually my project could be even more complex, but I really wanted to finish it before New Year of 2023.  I'll talk later about how could this project could evolve. But for now let's focus on how it became, what it's now.  


## Distinctiveness and Complexit
This project satisfies the complexity and requirements of final project for webCS50, because:
* it's unique, we learned nothing like this project during the course
* project is very complex, it took me a month to build the conditions and operation usints as destination, delivery plans
